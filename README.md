# Poweruser

My scripts and tweaks that I like to use for my workflow. 

I have configuration files for two window managers:

* Dwm using a Dracula theme and some patches like cool autostart, systray, slstatus and uselessgap. Reminder: this dwm patch I only use for ubuntu based distros like Linux mint.
* Bspwm using polybar and keyboard shortcuts for sxhkd. 

Scripts for linux distributions - I will change some things later.

*Ubuntu-based
*Fedora
*Arch-base
*Void Linux

Obs.: I'm not responsible if something on your system breaks.
